## Automation üöÄ

### This Repo

![cli](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19335151/183495833-df1387a7-b0a8-46a3-9144-90f3477b6f81.png)

- Download and use the [included .exe](https://github.com/bradmartin333/DevOpsCLI/raw/master/DevOpsCLI/bin/Release/DevOpsCLI.exe) for the automation available currently in this repo
    - Right now, all it does is create hardcoded child tasks for a user determined work item
    - If an exception occurs and the program exits, it is likely that the earlier steps were not completed or not enough time has elapsed since the creation of the work item ID
- Clone the repo and tinker as needed with the aid of the [Azure CLI docs online](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/boards?view=azure-cli-latest)

### PowerShell ‚ù§

All Windows 10 computers have PowerShell and PowerShell ISE
- Also, [all operating systems can install PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell)
- The same operations performed by the .exe in this repo can be performed and tinkered with using [this powershell script](https://github.com/bradmartin333/DevOpsCLI/blob/master/MakeTasks.ps1)
    - GitHub files can be saved by right clicking the "Raw" button in the top right of the file then clicking "Save link as..."
    - Save that file locally, right click it, then click "Run with PowerShell" and enter the User Story ID when prompted
    - Or, open that file in PowerShell ISE to tinker with it (I recommend making this the deafult app for opening .ps1 files)
    - If an exception occurs, the permissions likely are not set - just execute this command in PowerShell
        - `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
    - The online docs for PowerShell and the Azure CLI are very good
